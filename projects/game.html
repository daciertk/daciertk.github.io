        <h1>Burger Dash Game</h1>
        <p>Burger Dash is a two player game written in TypeScript using the WebGL Library. Players compete to
            race around the map and build their burger first.

        <h2>Models and Animation</h2>
        <p>Multiple game elements, such as the player, trees, and burger ingredients, were created in blender.
            I exported them and used an external library to load them into webgl. The moving trees were also animated
            in blender and the player moving animation was done using motion capture (so it's an animation of me walking
            you're looking at!). 
        </p>
        <h3>Textures</h3>
        <p>Every model in the game is textured. I used a variety of PNGs as the textures. In fact, texturing works
            much simpler than it looks. The renderer transposes the coordinate of the model to a pixel on the reference image, 
            and draws that image to the screen. Texturing also allowed me to reuse some of the models: I have one model for the burger patty,
            tomato, and cheese and just changed the texture image and scaling.
        </p>
        <h3>Fog</h3>
        <p>In the last step before drawing to the screen, I added one last transformation to the pixel color before
            drawing to the screen. I added some shader code that increases the opacity of the pixels further away from 
            the player, creating a foggy effect. It was pretty simple to implement and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the 
            game area. 
        </p>
        <h3>Billboarding</h3>
        <p>The small shrubs are created using a combination of multiple effects. It's first textured using a reference image of a shrub. 
            The image has a dark gray background, and I added a check that only draws the pixel if it is not a gray pixel. 
            This makes the shrub see thru, allowing everything in the background to be seen through the shrub. Finally, I used a 
            technique called "Billboarding", which rotates the shrub to face the player every frame. The rotation is noticable up fron,
            but further away it makes the shrub look 3d. These tricks make a 2d image of a shrub look like a 3d model without adding a 
            ton of computational complexity from another model.
        </p>

        <h3>Sky</h3>
        <p>I created the sky using a "skybox". A skybox is a 3d cube rendered as a box around the camera with everything else 
            in the environment rendered in front of it. It's textured using 6 images of a sky that combine to create a seamless
            background from all angles.
