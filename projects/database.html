      <h1>Formula 1 Database Project</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
          <p >For our semester long Database project, our group identified a process that could me modeled and improved 
            through an interactive database application. We chose Formula 1 Logistics (more information in the project information below).
            to model in a database app. Our process starting by identifing the core users and functionality the app would provide them. 
            Next, we identified the primary entities our system would model. The last step in our planning invloved sketching out various database
            diagrams until we created a diagram of a relational database for our system.
          </p>
          <p >
            During the next phase, we implemented our database (we chose PostgreSQL as our Database Management System) and filled our
            database with a mix of real (race schedule, teams) and randomly generated (names, container contents) data. This portion of the project was
            the most iterative as we often had to rebuild the database later on when we found bugs or ways we could improve our database.
          </p>  
          <p >
            The last step was creating a webapp that provided functionality to the different users. The Team Managers can track the status
            of their equipment and select how its shipped, Race Organizers can manage the calendar and can schedule races, and Race Crew members
            can track the equipment needed to run each race.
