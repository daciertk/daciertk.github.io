<p>Project Title: <strong>Formula One Logistical Database (F1LDB)</strong></p>

<p>Short Name: <strong>DR</strong></p>
<p>Team Members: <strong>Stella Lee, Kane Dacier, Gavin Barro, Austin Earl</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Formula One (F1)</strong> is the highest level of motorsport, featuring open-wheel, single seater cars that race at high speeds on circuits across the world. Governed by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), F1 is renowned for its combination of cutting-edge engineering, driver skills, and team strategy. Teams design their cars with strict regulations, focusing on aerodynamics, tire management, and power units. Races, known as Grand Prixs, take place on diverse tracks ranging from purpose built courses to street circuits. Drivers accumulate points throughout the season, with championships awarded for both drivers and teams based on overall performance.</p>
<p>We propose to develop the “Formula 1 Logistical Database (F1LDB)” which is the central location for Race Organizers, Team Managers, and Crew Members to keep track of the large amounts of equipment that will trot the globe during the Formula 1 season. F1LDB will allow Race Organizers to add Formula 1 races to the calendar and schedule the shipping of the equipment between races. Team Managers can manage the status of their equipment as it is loaded and unloaded and select how it will be shipped. Race Crew Members manage the equipment and supplies owned by the league (broadcasting equipment etc) and are able to log on and keep track of the equipment.</p>

<p>The F1LDB simplifies tracking of equipment by having a cohesive database that displays location and shipping information. With this, teams can efficiently determine which equipment needs to be shipped for current/future races. Historical data on previous races can also be incorporated for reference for the users of the system which can help improve planning for future races.</p>
<p>Race Events are individual F1 Races. Each season features about 20 races occurring every week or two. The Team Kits are the equipment owned by each individual team. They have the tires, mechanics equipment, uniforms etc. Our system does not care about the contents of each kit, that is for each team to manage at their own level. Containers are the equipment owned by the F1 League and contain the necessary equipment to run each race.</p>

<p>Race Event Organizers are the highest level of authority in the database. Their primary role is to schedule races in the system, as well as the shipping of equipment to and from the race location. Team Managers are the point of contact for each team. They tell the database when their team’s equipment is loaded and unloaded from shipping. They also select which shipment to use to ship their team kit. Race Crew Members are in charge of the equipment owned by the F1 League, such as broadcasting equipment, officiating equipment, etc. They tell the database when the equipment is loaded and unloaded.</p>
