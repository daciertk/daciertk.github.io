        <p>
            Formula 1 is thge highest level of motorsport in the world. The globe-trotting, big money race schedule involves
            moving a huge amount of parts, equipment, and people around the world every week. We propose the Formula 1 Database (F1DB) as 
            the central location for Race Organizers, Team Managers, and Crew Members to track the equipment that will trot the globe during
            the 20 week schedule.

        <h2>Super Mega Burger Dash</h2>
        <p>
          Super Mega Burger Dash is a two player browser game written in javascript using WebGL. Each player competes to race around the map and collect the 
          ingredients (patty, tomato, cheese, bun) to their growing hamburger. The game features multiple 3D models created and animated in Blender and ported to the game, 
          effects such as texturing, fog, and skybox. The player character even uses a motion capture animation recorded by me!
